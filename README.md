# renv2binder

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `renv2binder` is to convert lockfiles from `rv` and `renv`
to a Binder friendly format.

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is a powerful tool for hands on
reproducible research. You can add a button on your repository that will
launch a Jupyter or RStudio instance that has your analysis code
available, with all required packages. Under the hood, it uses a package
called `repo2docker` that converts your repository to a Docker container
with Jupyter/RStudio installed.

The main issue is that [Binder requires a `DESCRIPTION` or `install.R`
file](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/research/),
which are not generated by `renv` or `rv`. This package will convert
either type of lockfile to your choice of file into the root of your
repository.

## Installation

You can install the development version of renv2binder like so:

``` r
pak::pak_install("laderast/renv2binder")
```

## Example

If you have already initialized `renv` in your project, then you will
have a `renv.lock` in the project folder.

If not, and you’re not using `renv`, you can still use
`renv::snapshot()` to create this file.

``` r
library(renv2binder)
## basic example code
## Run this in your project after using renv::snapshot()
lockfile_path <- system.file("extdata", "renv.lock", package="renv2binder")
lockfile <- load_renv_lockfile(lockfile_path)
renv_to_install_r(lockfile,file_out="./install.R")
```

    File is created as install.R
